            <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal portfolio page. I am so very excited to be able to share my work. Coding is a new
            adventure for me. I am always looking for new ways to learn and better myself.</p>
            <p>I have three amazing young men in my life, Jacob, Bobby, and Lukas. They are my pride and joy. 
                I treasure these years because I know that they move quickly. In a blink of an eye they will be grown up. 
                I don't want to miss a thing!</p>
            <p> My fiance is the most supportive and I wouldn't be here without him. He pushed me to apply
                 and I am so happy that I did.</p>
